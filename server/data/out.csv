"NZ, N, Wellington",Vend + Wellington in a Tree ....,,"Hi, this is Vend. You might have heard of us. We really dig your city, and love to spend time there. We keep popping down for Webstock, WDCNZ, and other events. Sometimes we just come down for a weekend to hang out because we like you. It's getting a bit serious to be honest.So yeah. Ummm, we'd like to move in. Have you got a spare room? We promise not to be too messy: we'll clean up after the big parties and we love pets, so we're happy to share a room with them.What do you think? Can we make this work? Please say yes.","We'd be looking for a few things to make sure we can all get along. Web devs basically, but what we're planning to do is build up a fully independent engineering team at your place. It would need some people like this:- Front-end web devs. Ideally you're a total Javascript nerd, perhaps with a bit of Angular experience, but we can teach you that if you're super keen. You dig modular, clean JS; modern JS tooling like Gulp and Browserify; and perhaps even enjoy detangling a bit of callback soup. You'd need to work with our designers to translate their stuff into HTML and SASS/SMACSS too, but if you're cool with plain old HTML5/CSS you'll pick that up quick.- Backend web devs. You're an OO monster who dreams in REST. You grok MVC patterns, and understand that a modern web stack has a shitload of moving parts. Sure there's some core code there (we use Go and PHP), but the stuff like Unit Testing, Redis, Elastic Search, Git / Github, Resque, MySQL, Selenium and Nginx (and more) all play a part. We're absolutely not precious about PHP knowledge by the way.- Quality Assistance lovelies. Yeah that's right: we don't call it ""testing"" or ""quality assurance"". Quality at Vend is all about working together to get the most robust outcome. That means being involved in building features from day one - building automated test tools, using your analytical skills to guide developers around potential pitfalls, and checking that they don't fall into them after ignoring you. Bloody developers.- DevOps &amp; Infrastructure homies. Our continuous deployment setup at Vend is *tight* (as the kids would say). We deploy multiple times a day to our production stack, so we need people who really dig deployment and infrastructure automation, and know all about scalability and performance of fairly complex web applications. We promise you can have a big TV full of graphs to put up on the wall too.Do you fit one of the descriptions above? If so we'd be super stoked if you could get in touch. We're keen to move in really soon.Vend xoxo",,0

"US, VA, woodbridge ",Looking for go getters that want to receive weekly P/T pay,,"We have the demand. We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. What we are looking for: * A passion to honestly help families. * Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. * A person who can follow a step by step selling system. What we are not looking for: *Someone who isn't accountable to their word. *Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. *Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) We need you and you need us.

"US, MD, Fort Washington",Part Time Opportunity for Professionals,,"We have the demand. We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. What we are looking for: * A passion to honestly help families. * Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. * A person who can follow a step by step selling system. What we are not looking for: *Someone who isn't accountable to their word. *Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. *Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) We need you and you need us.

"US, VA, stafford",We need 25 Agents growing company-See below,,"We have the demand. We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. What we are looking for: * A passion to honestly help families. * Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. * A person who can follow a step by step selling system. What we are not looking for: *Someone who isn't accountable to their word. *Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. *Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) We need you and you need us.

The individual must manage the technical issues that arise during the approval process and ensure a rapid resolution by working with and through the sales engineers, ODMs and Component vendors. A word from the Recruiter: ""Some of the exciting things that retain engineers here are the new technologies that we integrate into our products. Most People hear about these technologies 9 months after the product development has launched, our engineers actually start learning about the new technologies in advance of any silicon introductions. In most cases, we are an early partner to silicon vendors and help guide the silicon features. This is extremely rare for many of the new members, once they do the first project they want more and more. As you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door."" ""Most engineers that I interview have been disappointed by their employers, and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed, the answer is always something like : I only did this this portion of the software, or some portion of the chip, or some portion of the hardware. Not much of an empowerment here.  Here, the PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product, including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc. This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from, this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope. The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity."" This is what not shared on the JD. ""How you will mature your career."" Job Responsibilities: • For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production; including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and Agile release requirements, per Netgear policies.

The individual must manage the technical issues that arise during the approval process and ensure a rapid resolution by working with and through the sales engineers, ODMs and Component vendors. A word from the Recruiter: ""Some of the exciting things that retain engineers here are the new technologies that we integrate into our products. Most People hear about these technologies 9 months after the product development has launched, our engineers actually start learning about the new technologies in advance of any silicon introductions. In most cases, we are an early partner to silicon vendors and help guide the silicon features. This is extremely rare for many of the new members, once they do the first project they want more and more. As you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door."" ""Most engineers that I interview have been disappointed by their employers, and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed, the answer is always something like : I only did this this portion of the software, or some portion of the chip, or some portion of the hardware. Not much of an empowerment here.  Here, the PE is the complete owner of every molecule of the product, including mechanical, operation, finance, cost, etc. This empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from, this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope. The more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity."" This is what not shared on the JD. ""How you will mature your career."" Job Responsibilities: • For assigned projects, take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production; including requirements generation, hardware, firmware, documentation, regulatory testing and Agile release requirements, per Netgear policies.

Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace.

IHF provides education, and in some cases, homes, to children. IHF has no central headquarters; each center is a product of its environment and follows the cultural code and norms of its host country.We have four centers in Indonesia, in Bali, Jakarta, Medan and Banda Aceh. Our Jakarta and Aceh centers provide homes to a small number of children, while all centers offer English, math and computer classes to disadvantaged children. With a population of over 240 million, Indonesia’s public education system often fails to give children a chance to escape the poverty they were born into. We fill that gap and give kids a chance to aim higher.Our Thailand center is a home for hill-tribe children. Children from this marginalised community come to our center for a stable home and a chance for an education.Our Kenya center is a children’s home and also provides emergency relief to the surrounding community. This is the biggest IHF center, with approximately 100 kids. The kids are from the marginalised Pokot tribe, whose conditions are amongst the worse in Kenya. Living conditions in this region are harsh, and we provide basic needs such as a home, food, and access to education to children who would otherwise go without. We also run livestock donation projects and other initiatives to relieve the extreme poverty where we can.At the center, you will divide your time between caring for the children and working on international tasks. IHF is a grassroots, all-volunteer organisation with no central office, so all administration work is done in center. All volunteers manage one or more of our international task teams such as university relations, fundraising and media; working together online with volunteers in other centers. You will be assigned according to your experience. You must possess excellent time management skills.","Those who are secure without the comforts of home gain the most from this valuable opportunity. We are looking for applicants preferably with:- A related university degree; eg. in social studies, language, teaching, medicine, law, social work- Experience abroad; travel, working or volunteering- 1-2 years working experience in any field- Experience with teaching and/or childrenFluency in English, both written and spoken is essential. Those interested in volunteering at an IHF centre are required to complete a level of pre-trip duties in order to gain an understanding of how our organization functions.","Volunteers must commit to serve at least a year at the center. Basic accommodation and food is provided by IHF. You are a volunteer at the center, and all local tasks completed are done so without pay.

"US, NY, Brooklyn",Growth Hacker / Customer Acquisitions Manager,,"CommonBond is building a new kind of value-driven financial services company.We are beginning our mission by tackling the broken student lending market, and changing the way people think about student loans with lower borrowing costs, a state-of-the art technology platform, and high touch customer advocacy.We are backed by by great investors, have a killer team, and are growing exponentially.More info on recent growth here: #URL_724362e31e8b9c5b4d975d5c95e080c2454b4580fe904efe6501a07862bf7c5f#We’re looking for an analytical marketing expert with an unmistakable instinct for driving acquisition activity, strong technical and analytical prowess, and a relentless drive to deliver results. You’ve been called a “growth hacker”, a “go getter”, “savvy”, “smart”, “systematic” and maybe even ""scrappy."" There aren’t many people like you; just people who want to be like you. You know you’re talented, because you’re data driven and the results are on your side. But you’re also humble, and you’re looking to focus your talents on something you believe in. You have a history of growing user bases because you simply find a way to make things happen. You have a special skill for planning, but a scorn for using it. You are driven by a plan, but not led by it. You have a bias for immediate action and an uncanny instinct for channeling it effectively. Tomorrow is too late; yesterday is always on time. Your success may have come while running a single website business or from delivering exceptional results within an agency or corporate environment. Hopefully you’ve done this before at another startup and are ready for your next challenge. Regardless of where you learned your craft, you are driven by hitting goals and yearn for your success to be measured by growth metrics. CommonBond is a fast-paced, exciting environment where new opportunities emerge every day. The Growth Hacker role will be an early hire on a growing team at an innovative company that is on the cusp of scale. You will be the reason the company scales. You are definitely invigorated, maybe a little anxious, and above all excited by that fact.You will drive customer acquisition growth.To do so, you will implement campaigns across multiple online channels, including SEM, Social, Display, Retargeting, Content, Email, and Affiliate. You will design and implement A/B tests and other analytical frameworks for your campaigns. We wouldn’t be surprised if you put your technical skills to use to write a few lines of code that help you implement campaigns and better understand the results.But unlike any other such roles you’ve heard of, you will also use your smarts, and your proven entrepreneurial spirit, to make things happen. Your disdain for meetings and heavy bias towards action will move the company forward. You will go rogue because you have the wherewithal to act on proven instinct without anyone or anything getting in your way. Time is not your friend, urgency is your default, and action is your north star.You love our customers. You want to share our products with them because of how helpful they will be. You wake up every morning overwhelmed at the thought of ensuring enough people take advantage of what CommonBond has to offer. Feeling overwhelmed drives you, rather than paralyzes you. In support of your acquisition goals, you will: Develop a roadmap for identifying, testing, and optimizing new channels.Analyze and report on all marketing programs with focus on ROI optimization.Work with design and production team to develop marketing units, ads, emails and collateral.Above all, results will determine your success. You’ll need only enough analysis and reporting to demonstrate the success you’re driving in the business.","Bachelor’s degree.Demonstrated track record of increasing acquisition numbers and executing successful campaigns.Experience with some or all of the following:  Adwords, Bing, Facebook ads, Twitter ads, LinkedIn ads, A/B testing software (e.g., Optimizely), and ESPs (e.g. MailChimp).Experience building reports, analyzing campaign data, and quickly learning as we grow.Demonstrated ability to thrive in a fast paced, rapidly changing environment.Strong written/oral communication skills, with an ability to create order and flexible processes when needed.Entrepreneurial, responsible, self-motivated, upbeat team player.Creative thinker and resourceful problem solver.Eye for designSome experience with a programming language is a plus.","Health care, paid gym membership, Friday team lunches, and a fully stocked kitchen",0
